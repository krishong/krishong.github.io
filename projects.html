		Characterizing urban heat islands
	</h2>

	Extreme heat events can be dangerous to human health. These events are amplified in urban environments because of the urban heat island effect, where dense infrastructure and sparse vegetation render developed areas warmer than their surroundings. To better characterize heat islands, we conducted a high spatial resolution temperature monitoring campaign during Summer 2019 in Montreal. 
	<br><br>
	Pictured: A screenshot from our Shiny app linked below, showing temperatures several degrees warmer in the urban core compared to suburban areas on July 4 at 2 AM.

		Urban greenness and temperature
	</h2>
	<img style="float: left; padding: 5px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/files/figures/temperature_greenness_maps.jpg" width="400">
	Twenty routes were walked in Vancouver with a temperature logger and GoPro camera. We evaluated the relationship between air temperature and urban greenness at the microscale level, where greenness values were calculated from ~10 million frames of video footage using OpenCV. 
	<br><br>
	Pictured: Data collected during two walking routes. The time series plots of raw and smoothed z-scores in the first column show clear inverse relationships between temperature and greenness. This relationship is also seen between the mapped values in the second and third columns.

		Extending the spatial coverage of land use regression models
	</h2>
	<img style="float: left; padding: 5px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/files/figures/extending_lur_predictions.jpg" width="400">
	Land use regression models are limited in spatial coverage due to the cost of acquiring detailed land use data. We proposed a method for extending the coverage of these models by leveraging convolutional neural networks to infer land use information from aerial images.
	<br><br>
	Pictured: The orange outlines in column one indicate the spatial coverage of existing land use regression models, and the red outlines indicate the extended spatial coverage of the convolutional neural network models. Column two shows predictions from the convolutional neural network models for ultrafine particle concentrations in Montreal and Toronto.

		Predicting annual average global PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations

	<img style="float: left; padding: 5px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/files/figures/satellite_pm_predicted_vs_true.jpg" width="400">
	Understanding the distribution of global fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentrations is essential towards modelling global public health. We proposed a method for predicting annual average global PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations from satellite images using convolutional neural networks.

		Ranking communities by residential woodsmoke pollution
	</h2>
	<img style="float: left; padding: 5px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/files/figures/residential_woodsmoke_smoky_rankings.jpg" width="400">
	Wood burning stoves are an underregulated source of fine particulate matter, often surpassing vehicular and industrial emissions in rural communities. We developed an algorithm to empirically rank communities by residential woodsmoke impacts, allowing stakeholders to prioritize their limited resources towards implementing intervention strategies in the most affected communities.
	<br><br>
	Pictured: Heat maps showing average monthly and bi-hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations for 23 communities ordered by residential woodsmoke impacts.

		Seasonal particulate matter and health outcomes
	</h2>
	<img style="float: left; padding: 5px 20px 20px 0px;" src="/files/figures/road_dust_regr_coefs.jpg" width="400">
	We identified three distinct seasons where either residential woodsmoke, road dust, or wildfire smoke dominated particulate matter emissions in British Columbia, Canada. We fit a seasonally-stratified Poisson regression model to investigate the relationship between particulate matter and health outcomes.
	<br><br>
	Pictured: Regression and random effect meta-analysis results for the relationship between percent change in nonaccidental mortality (y-axis) and a one interquartile range increase in different categories of particulate matter stratified by season. Vertical lines indicate the 95% confidence intervals for the mean effect sizes.
