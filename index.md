I am a **data analyst** with expertise in managing large datasets and translating complex data into actionable insights through creative problem solving and **reproducible** programming. I am an avid user of both **R** and **Python** for all facets of analytics, including data wrangling, visualisation, storytelling, statistical analysis, predictive modelling, and machine learning. 

I received my B.Sc. Statistics at the University of British Columbia in 2018. During my studies, I spent two years working as a data analyst at the BC Centre for Disease Control under the training of public health statistican Dr. Sarah Henderson. Most recently, I worked jointly as a data analyst in the [Weichenthal Research Group](https://scottweichenthal.weebly.com/) at McGill University and as a research intern at Element AI. During that time, I co-founded [AI for Earth](http://aiforearthca.weebly.com/), an initiative for leveraging machine learning to address the impacts of environmental pollutants on human health. 

I am currently looking for data science opportunities in the UK, where I am on an unrestricted work authorization visa. I invite you to take a look at some of my [past projects](projects), and to reach out to me by [email](https://mailhide.io/e/211Y5) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisyhong/) if you would like to connect.
